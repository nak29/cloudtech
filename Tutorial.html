            <p><br>
                To begin creating your docker repository, you are going to create a directory. You can do this with the command <b>‘mkdir [directory-name]’</b> For the purposes of this tutorial, we will name our directory apache2directory. You are now going to enter the directory you just created and inside it create a new file text file. To get into the directory, you use the command <b>‘cd apache2directory’</b>; once you are inside the directory, use the command <b>‘vim [docker-file-name]’</b> to create the new text file (which we will name DockerFile).
                <br><br>
                After inputting the command, you should be able to type in a new file using VIM.
                <br><br>
                At the top of this new file, you are going to type out your docker definition. Your docker definition defines how your image is going to run on other machines upon start up. For our example, we are going to use Ubuntu as our base image. To begin our definition, we will add two lines. The first line should read <b>‘FROM ubuntu:latest’</b> and the second should read <b>‘MAINTAINER [your preferred name]’</b> (the name part is only for others to see who developed the image).
                <br><br>
                From here, we are going to add some commands to help build the image. The following series of “RUN” commands are going to be executed during the image building process. The first two commands you type should be <b>‘RUN apt-get update’</b> and <b>‘RUN apt-get install -y apache2’</b>. These two lines will execute while the image is being built. The next two lines are going to create essential directories. These lines are <b>‘RUN mkdir -p /var/lock/apache2’</b> and <b>‘RUN mkdir -p /var/run/apache2’</b>.
                <br><br>
                With these commands, our image will be built correctly, but now we must build the environment of our image. The “ENV” keyword sets an environment variable inside the docker image. We will set a very basic environment, but feel free to add on what you need for your specific project. You will notice that each line is very self explanatory, as the user and group variables are very basic (because we don’t have a hierarchy of users yet), the run and lock variables are designated to their directories, etc. The commands are:
                <br><br>
                <i>ENV APACHE_RUN_USER www-data<br><br>
                ENV APACHE_RUN_GROUP www-data<br><br>
                ENV APACHE_PID_FILE /var/run/apache2.pid<br><br>
                ENV APACHE_RUN_DIR /var/run/apache2<br><br>
                ENV APACHE_LOCK_DIR /var/lock/apache2<br><br>
                ENV APACHE_LOG_DIR /var/log/apache2<br><br>
                ENV LANG C</i>
                <br><br>
                The last two lines of the files are <b>‘CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2","-D","FOREGROUND"]’</b> and <b>‘EXPOSE 80’</b>. In short, the CMD command pushes the image in front of any other visuals, and the EXPOSE command allows the port ‘80’ to be reachable by others. With these last two lines in your file, you can now save and exit VIM using <b>“:wq!”</b>.
                <br><br>
                The next step after exiting out of the file is building the image by running a command. The command is <b>‘docker build -t apacheubuntu2:[VERSION GOES HERE] .</b>’. To find your version, check ubuntu resources to use the most up to date version. We will be using version 1.0. This will take a longer time than previous processes because it is running all of the lines you typed previously. Once the processes finish, the docker image is now finished. You can use the command ‘docker image ls’ to find your new repository.
                <br><br>
                To create the container itself, run the command <b>‘docker run -t -d -P --name apache2directory apacheubunt2:1.0’</b>. This will create the container, which you can view using the command <b>‘docker container ls’</b>. After running this command, you can view where your port is mapped to. It should look something similar to this: <b>‘0.0.0.0:NUMBER->80’</b> where NUMBER is the mapped port.
                <br><br>
                From this point on, your container is up, running, and able to be reached via web browser! Find the IP address of the container using the command <b>‘ifconfig’</b>, type the IP address into your preferred web browser, attach the mapped port from before using a colon, and you should see your ubuntu page! If this does not work, check if you typed your IP address in the correct format of ‘http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:####’ where the x’s are your IP address and the # symbols are the port number.
